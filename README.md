# ThaumcraftResearchTree

That project is improved version of https://github.com/aDragon1/Thaumic-Augmentation-Parser (Android app instead of CLI + project under link is just creating outputfile)

That app display's all Thaumcraft(+mods) research in scorllable list and on click of each item it show's dependices of clicked item (everything translated on Ru)
